Given a number in its binary form find if the given binary number is a multiple of 3. It is recommended to finish the task using one traversal of input binary number.
Example 1:
Input: S = "0011"
Output: 1
Explanation: "0011" is 3, which is divisible by 3.

code:
class Solution{
public:	
		
	int isDivisible(string s){
	    //complete the function here
	    int i,odd=0,eve=0,n=s.size();
	    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
	        if(s[i]=='1'){
	            if(i%2)odd++;
	            else eve++;
	        }
	    }
	    return (odd-eve)%3==0;
	}

};
